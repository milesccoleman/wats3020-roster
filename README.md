# WATS 3020 Roster Project

In this project you will add Class objects to fill in the functionality of a
simple course roster. This will require you to model objects for a `Person`,
`Student`, and `Teacher` in addition to providing specific methods so the roster
can function.

The goal of this project is to become more familiar with how to create and
extend Class objects, and how to make use of Class methods within your code.

## Basic Requirements

In order to successfully complete this project, you must:

* Complete all of the TODO requirements in the `js/main.js` file.
* Create the needed Classes to fill in functionality on the roster: `Person`, `Student`, and `Teacher`.
* Create the needed methods on the `Student` Class to handle calculating attendance.
* Create the needed methods on the `Course` Class to handle roster management.
* Provide helpful comments throughout your code (and remove the TODO comments when done).
* Write stylistically consistent, syntactically corrent JS.

## Stretch Goals

If you are able to easily fulfill the requirements above, try completing these
stretch goals.

* Add a way to remove a Teacher from the course (put a `removeTeacher()` method on the `Course` class).
* Add a way to remove a Student from the course.
* Create `markPresent()` and `markAbsent()` methods on the `Student` Class and use those from within the `Course` Class' `markAttendance()` method.
* Build better error-checking in the `Person` constructor to make sure people have put in an email address with an `@` symbol.
* Enhance the display of attendance information to show the number of present and absent days.
* **ADVANCED:** Instead of using `prompt()` commands, use an HTML form(s) to collect information from the user.
